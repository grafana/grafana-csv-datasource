# CSV data source for Grafana

> [!CAUTION]
> This plugin is now in maintenance mode, no new features will be added. We recommend using the [Infinity data source plugin](https://grafana.com/grafana/plugins/yesoreyeram-infinity-datasource/) instead.  If you want to get started quickly with CSV and Grafana, please read [How to Visualize CSV Data with Grafana](https://grafana.com/blog/2025/02/05/how-to-visualize-csv-data-with-grafana/), which uses the recommended approach.

## Legacy Information

The Grafana CSV Datasource plugin is designed to load CSV data into Grafana, expanding your capabilities to visualize and analyze data stored in CSV (Comma-Separated Values) format. Whether you have log files, historical data, or other datasets in CSV format, this plugin streamlines the process of integrating this data into your Grafana dashboards.

## Documentation

For comprehensive instructions on setting up and configuring the Grafana CSV Datasource, please consult our official [documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/plugins/marcusolsson-csv-datasource/latest/).
